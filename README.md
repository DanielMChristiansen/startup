# Schedulify

[My Notes](notes.md)

Users will sign up and provide calendar links from Canvas and/or LearningSuite classes. The app will use those provided links to extract individual assignments, calculate school days remaining until due date, notify user about exams and essays in advance, and keep track of completed assignments. It will present this information in the form of a digital planner.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

In a time where students juggle so many responsibilities, keeping track of all their assignments from two different constantly updating platform can seem impossible. Luckily, Schedulify is an automated digital planner application integrating with Instructure Canvas and BYU LearningSuite allowing students to keep track of their assignments at a glance in a single location. The digital nature of the planner allows it to automatically keep up to date with changes made in Canvas or LearningSuite.
